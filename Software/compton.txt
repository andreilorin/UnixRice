Compton is a standalone compositor for Xorg, suitable for use with window managers that do not provide compositing.
Compton is a fork of xcompmgr-dana, which in turn is a fork of xcompmgr.

The default configuration is available in /etc/xdg/compton.conf.
For modifications, it can be copied to ~/.config/compton.conf, or to ~/.compton.conf.

To use a custom configuration file with compton during a session, use the following command:

$ compton --config path/to/compton.conf
To auto-start compton as a background (Daemon) process for a session, specify the -b argument:

$ compton --config path/to/compton.conf -b
Disable shadows for some windows
The shadow-exclude option can disable shadows for windows if required. For currently disabled windows, see here.

To disable shadows for menus add the following to wintypes in compton.conf:

# menu        = { shadow = false; };
dropdown_menu = { shadow = false; };
popup_menu    = { shadow = false; };
# utility     = { shadow = false; };
